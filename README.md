# First_ML_Model
This is a kaggle project where I was supposed to work on my first machine learning project from 'Intro to Machine Learning' course.

This project is based on 
- How Model Works
- Basic Data Exploration
- My First Machine Learning Model
- Model Validation
- Under Fitting & Overfitting
- Random Forests
